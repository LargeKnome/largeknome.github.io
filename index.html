        <h2>A BIT ABOUT ME</h2>
        <p>Hey, I'm Tom Fasham, a 3rd year Game Design student at QUT & independent game developer. </p>
        <p>I'm working out of Brisbane, Australia on a number of Independent & University video game projects. Check out my stuff!</p>

        <h2>SKILLS & ABILITIES</h2>
        <p>I've been working with the Unity engine for ~3 years, having used it to make a number of student projects, jam games, and prototypes. I most often take on a designer role, having done character, quest, level, and systems design across a range of projects.. </p>
        <p>I back that up with a strong programming ability, specifically gameplay programming. I've handled Player Controllers, NPC AI, Interactions Programming, and have on occasion delved into more intensive Systems Programming.</p>

        <p>In my free time, I'm working on PongDemonium!, a chaotic party game based on Pong (More in the works tab!).</p>
